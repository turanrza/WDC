                        <td class="col3">Images and other elements can be nested within a tags to make them hyperlinks. It's good practice to inclide the 'alt' attribute for an img tag to describe the image for the visually imparied and better search engine recognition. img is a self-closing tag<br/><br/>
                        In the example below .container represents a container div. It is set to a width of 50% (half of the browser’s width, in this example) and a height of 200 pixels. Setting overflow to hidden ensures that any content with dimensions larger than the container will be hidden from view.<br/>The second CSS rule ensures that images scale with the width of the container. The height property is set to auto, meaning an image’s height will automatically scale proportionally with the width. Finally, the last line will display images as block level elements (rather than inline-block, their default state). This will prevent images from attempting to align with other content on the page (like text), which can add unintended margin to the images.<br/>It’s worth memorizing the entire example above. It represents a very common design pattern used to scale images and videos proportionally.<br/>If the image is larger than the container, the vertical portion of the image will overflow and will not display. To swap this behavior, you can set max-height to 100% and width to auto (essentially swapping the values). This will scale the height of the image with the height of the container instead. If the image is larger than the container, the horizontal portion of the image will overflow and not display.

                        <td class="col3">CSS uses media queries to adapt a website’s content to different screen sizes. With media queries, CSS can detect the size of the current screen and apply different CSS styles depending on the width of the screen. The media query in the example defines a rule for screens smaller than 480 pixels (approximately the width of many smartphones in landscape orientation)
                            <ol>
                                <li>@media — This keyword begins a media query rule and instructs the CSS compiler on how to parse the rest of the rule</li>
                                <li>only screen — Indicates what types of devices should use this rule. In early attempts to target different devices, CSS incorporated different media types (screen, print, handheld). The rationale was that by knowing the media type, the proper CSS rules could be applied. However, “handheld” and “screen” devices began to occupy a much wider range of sizes and having only one CSS rule per media device was not sufficient. screen is the media type always used for displaying content, no matter the type of device. The only keyword is added to indicate that this rule only applies to one media type (screen)</li>
                                <li>and (max-width : 480px) — This part of the rule is called a media feature, and instructs the CSS compiler to apply the CSS styles to devices with a width of 480 pixels or smaller. Media features are the conditions that must be met in order to render the CSS within a media query</li>
                                <li>CSS rules are nested inside of the media query’s curly braces. The rules will be applied when the media query is met. In the example above, the text in the body element is set to a font-size of 12px when the user’s screen is less than 480px.</li></ol></td>

                        <td class="col3">Many times we will want to supply higher quality media (images, video, etc.) only to users with screens that can support high resolution media. Targeting screen resolution also helps users avoid downloading high resolution (large file size) images that their screen may not be able to properly display.<br/><br/>To target by resolution, we can use the min-resolution and max-resolution media features. These media features accept a resolution value in either dots per inch (dpi) or dots per centimeter (dpc). <br/><br/>The and operator can be used to require multiple media features. Therefore, we can use the and operator to require both a max-width of 480px and to have a min-resolution of 300dpi. By placing the and operator between two media features, the browser will require both media features to be true before it renders the CSS within the media query.<br/><br/>If only one of multiple media features in a media query must be met, media features can be separated in a comma separated list. For example, if we needed to apply a style when only one of the below is true: 1) The screen is more than 480 pixels wide OR 2) The screen is in landscape mode - we could write the media features separated by commas, as is shown in the second example. (note that the second media feature is orientation. The orientation media feature detects if the page has more width than height. If a page is wider, it’s considered landscape, and if a page is taller, it’s considered portrait)</td>

                        <td class="col3">To set up a grid, you need to have both a grid container and grid items. The grid container will be a parent element that contains grid items as children and applies overarching styling and positioning to them. To turn an HTML element into a grid container, you must set the element’s display property to grid (for a block-level grid) or inline-grid (for an inline grid). Then, you can assign other properties to lay out the grid.<br/>By default, grids contain only one column. If you were to start adding items, each item would be put on a new row; that’s not much of a grid! To change this, we need to explicitly define the number of rows and columns in our grid. Creating two or more columns can be done with <strong>grid-template-columns</strong>. Setting the length of the columns using % requires the width of the grid to be specified.<br/><br/>Similary, <strong>grid-template-rows</strong> defines the number of rows and sets each row’s height. When using percentages in these two properties, remember that rows are defined as a percentage of the grid’s height, and columns are defined as a percentage of its width.<br/><br/>The property <strong>grid-template</strong> can replace the previous two CSS properties. When using grid-template, the values before the slash will determine the size of each row. The values after the slash determine the size of each column.

                        <td class="col3">By using the fr unit, we can define the size of columns and rows as a fraction of the grid’s length and width. This unit was specifically created for use in CSS Grid. Using fr makes it easier to prevent grid items from overflowing the boundaries of the grid.<br/><br/>In this example, the grid will have three rows and three columns. The rows are splitting up the available 400 pixels of height into four parts. The first row gets two of those parts, the second row gets one, and the third row gets one. Therefore the first row is 200 pixels tall, and the second and third rows are 100 pixels tall.<br/><br/>Each column’s width is a fraction of the available space. In this case, the available space is split into five parts. The first column gets one-fifth of the space, the second column gets three-fifths, and the last column gets one-fifth. Since the total width is 1000 pixels, this means that the columns will have widths of 200 pixels, 600 pixels, and 200 pixels respectively.<br/><br/>It is possible to use fr with other units as well (1fr 60px 1fr). When this happens, each fr represents a fraction of the available space. In this example, 60 pixels are taken up by the second column. Therefore the first and third columns have 40 available to split between them. Since each gets one fraction of the total, they both end up being 20 pixels wide.</td>

New grid rows will only be tall enough to contain the content within them.<br/>CSS Grid provides two properties to specify the size of grid tracks added implicitly: <strong>grid-auto-rows</strong> and <strong>grid-auto-columns</strong>. grid-auto-rows and grid-auto-columns accept the same values as their explicit counterparts, grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns: pixels, fractions, percentages and the repeat() function. If we did not specify grid-auto-rows, the rows would be auto-adjusted to the height of the content of the grid items. The grid adds implicit rows by default. These properties are declared on grid containers.</td>

There are five different position values and after the position value is chosen, are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value. <br/>1) <strong>static</strong>: not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page + static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties. <br/>2) <strong>relative</strong>: allows you to position an element relative to its default static position on the web page. Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element. <br/>3) <strong>fixed</strong>: position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element. A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located. <br/>4) <strong>absolute</strong>: positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling. When an element’s position is set to absolute all other elements on the page will ignore the element and act like it is not present on the page. The element will be positioned relative to its closest positioned parent element. <br/>5) <strong>sticky</strong>: positioned based on the user's scroll position. A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed)</td>

                        <td class="col3">The display property specifies the display behavior (the type of rendering box) of an element. It dictates if the element can share horizontal space with other elements. Some elements fill the entire browser from left to right regardless of the size of their content. Other elements only take up as much horizontal space as their content requires and can be directly next to other elements. <br/><strong>Inline elements</strong> (em, strong, a are all inline by default) have a box that wraps tightly around their content, only taking up the amount of space necessary to display their content and not requiring a new line after each element. The height and width of these elements cannot be specified in the CSS document. <br/> <strong>Block-level elements</strong> (div, p, footer, h1-h6 are all inline by default) fill the entire width of the page by default, but their width/height property can also be set. Unless otherwise specified, they are the height necessary to accommodate their content.<br/><strong>Inline-block display</strong> combines features of both inline and block elements. Inline-block elements can appear next to each other and we can specify their dimensions using the width and height properties. Images are the best example of default inline-block elements. <br/>Click <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/pr_class_display.asp" target="_blank">here</a> to view different property values.</td>

The float property can have one of the following values: left, right, none, inherit. Floated elements must have a width specified, as in the example above. Otherwise, the element will assume the full width of its containing element, and changing the float value will not yield any visible results.</td>

Specifically, elements can “bump” into each other and not allow other elements to properly move to the left or right. The clear property specifies <strong>how elements should behave when they bump into each other on the page</strong>. It can take on one of the following values:<br/><strong>left</strong> — the left side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing element.<br/><strong>right</strong> — the right side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing element.<br/><strong>both</strong> — neither side of the element will touch any other element within the same containing element; and <br/><strong>none</strong> - the element can touch either side.</td>

                    <td class="col3">Character sets, denoted by a pair of brackets [], let us match one character from a series of characters, allowing for matches with incorrect or different spellings. The regex con[sc]en[sc]us will match consensus, the correct spelling of the word, but also match the following three incorrect spellings: concensus, consencus, and concencus. A character class matches only a single character. gr[ae]y does not match graay, graey or any such thing. Thus the regex [cat] will match the characters c, a, or t, but not the text cat.<br/><br/>We can make our character sets even more powerful with the help of the caret ^ symbol. Placed at the front of a character set, the ^ negates the set, matching any character that is not stated. These are called negated character sets. Thus the regex [^cat] will match any character that is not c, a, or t, and would completely match each character d, o or g.</td>

                    <td class="col3">There are shorthand character classes that represent common ranges, and they make writing regular expressions much simpler:
                        <ul>
                            <li>\w: the “word character” class represents the regex range [A-Za-z0-9_], and it matches a single uppercase character, lowercase character, digit or underscore</li>
                            <li>\d: the “digit character” class represents the regex range [0-9], and it matches a single digit character</li>
                            <li>\s: the “whitespace character” class represents the regex range [ \t\r\n\f\v], matching a single space, tab, carriage return, line break, form feed, or vertical tab</li>
                        </ul>
                    In addition to the shorthand character classes \w, \d, and \s, we also have access to the negated shorthand character classes! These shorthands will match any character that is NOT in the regular shorthand classes. These negated shorthand classes include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>\W: the “non-word character” class represents the regex range [^A-Za-z0-9_], matching any character that is not included in the range represented by \w</li>
                        <li>\D: the “non-digit character” class represents the regex range [^0-9], matching any character that is not included in the range represented by \d</li>
                        <li>\S: the “non-whitespace character” class represents the regex range [^ \t\r\n\f\v], matching any character that is not included in the range represented by \s</li></ul></td>

                    <td class="col3">What if we want to match the whole piece of text I love baboons and I love gorillas with the same regex? Your first guess might be to use the regex I love baboons|gorillas. This regex, while it would completely match the string I love baboons, would not match I love gorillas, and would instead match gorillas. This is because the | symbol matches the entire expression before or after itself. Grouping, denoted with the open parenthesis ( and the closing parenthesis ), lets us group parts of a regular expression together, and allows us to limit alternation to part of the regex.<br/>The regex I love (baboons|gorillas) will match the text I love and then match either baboons or gorillas, as the grouping limits the reach of the | to the text within the parentheses.</td>
                    <td class="col4">I love baboons|gorilla[sz]<br/>I love (baboons|gorilla[sz]</td>

                <tr>
                    <th class="rowhead">Fixed Quantifiers</th>
                    <td class="col3">The answer is yes, with the help of quantifiers! Fixed quantifiers, denoted with curly braces {}, let us indicate the exact quantity of a character we wish to match, or allow us to provide a quantity range to match on.
                        <ul>
                            <li>\w{3} will match exactly 3 word characters</li>
                            <li>\w{4,7} will match at minimum 4 word characters and at maximum 7 word characters</li></ul>
                    The regex roa{3}r will match the characters ro followed by 3 a's, and then the character r, such as in the text roaaar. The regex roa{3,7}r will match the characters ro followed by at least 3 a's and at most 7 a's, followed by an r, matching the strings roaaar, roaaaaar and roaaaaaaar.<br/><br/>An important note is that quantifiers are considered to be greedy. This means that they will match the greatest quantity of characters they possibly can. For example, the regex mo{2,4} will match the text moooo in the string moooo, and not return a match of moo, or mooo. This is because the fixed quantifier wants to match the largest number of os as possible, which is 4 in the string moooo.</td>

                    <td class="col3">Optional quantifiers, indicated by the question mark ?, allow us to indicate a character in a regex is optional, or can appear either 0 times or 1 time. For example, the regex humou?r matches the characters humo, then either 0 occurrences or 1 occurrence of the letter u, and finally the letter r. Note the ? only applies to the character directly before it.<br/>With all quantifiers, we can take advantage of grouping to make even more advanced regexes. The regex The monkey ate a (rotten )?banana will completely match both The monkey ate a rotten banana and The monkey ate a banana.<br/>Since the ? is a metacharacter, you need to use the escape character in your regex in order to match a question mark ? in a piece of text.</td>

                    <td class="col3">The Kleene star, denoted with the asterisk *, is also a quantifier, and matches the preceding character 0 or more times. This means that the character doesn’t need to appear, can appear once, or can appear many many times.<br/>The regex meo*w will match the characters me, followed by 0 or more o's, followed by a w. Thus the regex will match mew, meow, meooow, and meoooooooooooow.</td>
